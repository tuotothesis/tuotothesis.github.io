Welcome to my first blog.

If you wanted to build a similar personal page, guides I find helpful are listed here:

1. A big shout out to the owner of this blog! This post here is most helpful in starting my journey in blogging:https://hot33331.github.io/first-blogpost/ 
1. Another page with comprehensive Jekyll introduction course and how to set up your configuration yml file: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/
1. I'm using minimal mistakes as my website theme: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/
1. Medium post (in Chinese) on using Jekyll in Markdown blogging:https://medium.com/@starshunter/%E7%94%A8-jekyll-%E5%92%8C-github-page-%E4%BE%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%A8%AD%E9%9D%9C%E6%85%8B-markdown-%E9%83%A8%E8%90%BD%E6%A0%BC-fcaa288d4dd7

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
